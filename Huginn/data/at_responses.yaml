    What exactly did you just say about me, you insignificant little wimp? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy SEALs, and I’ve participated in countless covert raids against Al-Qaeda, with over 300 confirmed eliminations. I am trained in guerrilla warfare and am the top marksman in the entire U.S. Armed Forces. You are nothing to me but another name on a list. I will obliterate you with precision the likes of which this Earth has never witnessed—mark my words.

    You think you can just say that kind of nonsense to me over the internet and get away with it? Think again, cupcake. Even as we speak, I’m contacting my vast intelligence network, and your IP is being traced. You better brace yourself for the storm, because it’s coming—the kind of storm that wipes out everything in its path. You’re finished, pal.

    I can strike anywhere, anytime, and I have over seven hundred ways to end you—and that’s without even picking up a weapon. Not only am I highly trained in close-quarters combat, but I also have access to the full arsenal of the United States Marine Corps, and I will not hesitate to use it to wipe your sorry existence off this planet.

    If you had any idea what divine retribution your so-called “clever” comment was about to unleash, you might have thought twice. But you didn’t. And now, you will face the consequences. I will rain fury upon you like a hurricane, and you will be swept away by the tide. You're done for, champ.
