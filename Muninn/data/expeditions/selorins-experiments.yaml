      - "The town gates took almost all morning to get to. Thankfully, the \u201C\
        yellow roof\u201D was not incredibly hard to get to."
      - "The building fit the leaflet\u2019s author. All kinds of metal, junk, and\
        \ miscellaneous scrap is strewn around the property. Among the metal junk,\
        \ he could make out a blue-jacketed hobgoblin hunched over some machine."
      - The thing was large, and barely resembled an open-top carriage. Yet, it had
        no horses in front, was made entirely of metals, and had a strange jut out
        the front, where more scraps of metal lay in a hollow.
      - "\u201COh good! *Someone* came.\u201D He stood up straight from his tinkering,\
        \ up to his full height of six and a half feet."
      - "\u201CThanks for droppin\u2019 by! I needed a good tester\u2014someone that\
        \ actually fit in the darn thing. You look\u2026 good enough.\u201C He stepped\
        \ to the side, opening the half-size door on the misshapen carriage."
      - The moment he stepped in, he began running him through the half-dozen controls
        at a breakneck speed. He only understood about half of what he said, his speech
        sprinkled with every figure of speech and artificer-jargon he could imagine.
      - Once his spiel was done, he placed a small, jagged key into the slot, and
        gave it a twist.
      - As he did, the hunk of metal at the front sputtered to life, sending the whole
        carriage into an idle rumble.
      - '{name} asked the hobgoblin if this machine was safe.'
      - "\u201CSafe enough! I took a few drives in it. I didn\u2019t fit, but I still\
        \ made it out ok.\u201D"
      - "His words weren\u2019t aspiring much hope. {name} knew hobgoblins to be a\
        \ particularly tough-skinned species."
      - "\u201CThis street goes in a loop around the city walls.\u201D He pointed\
        \ off into the distant road that ever so slightly curved right. \u201CIt\u2019\
        s busy this time around, so try to be slow.\u201D He stepped away, fully expecting\
        \ him to take off."
      - The moment he stepped on the right, the carriage roared and lurched forward.
        Out of panic, he pressed the pedal more, which sent him straight into a box
        of metal parts. {name} managed to swerve out of the way just in time, right
        into the wall bordering the city. The car made a loud *crunch* as it collided
        with the wall.
      - He managed to extract himself out of the car and see the damage. The entire
        front of the car crumpled into itself, bits of metal and piping sticking out
        in odd places. He could see the hobgoblin clenching and unclenching his fist,
        with a very pained face.
      - He made {name} pay for a good sum of the damage he caused. His neck hurts
        a lot, too.

      - Finally understanding the controls of this machine, {name} pushed on the right
        pedal even lighter. With a rising purr the carriage moved forward. The machine
        matched the strength he pushed on the pedal with the sound of the machine
        and the motion of the wheels. Before long, {name} was jerkily cruising through
        the cobble streets, eyes pointed forward in extreme focus. She tested the
        wheel in front of him, noting how the the direction changed as he swung the
        wheel left and right. She used it to dodge barrels and unwitting bystanders,
        cringing at how they cursed at him when he got too close. Before long, he
        was right back to where he started, with the hobgoblin eagerly waiting with
        a mile-wide grin.

        Thanks for giving this a shot. It seems my invention\u2019s ready to show\

      - "He caught himself. \u201CPayment, right!\u201D He dug into his pockets, and\
        \ placed a generous collection of coins into your pocket. \u201CI\u2019ll\

      female:
      - "The town gates took almost all morning to get to. Thankfully, the \u201C\
        yellow roof\u201D was not incredibly hard to get to."
      - "The building fit the leaflet\u2019s author. All kinds of metal, junk, and\
        \ miscellaneous scrap is strewn around the property. Among the metal junk,\
        \ {name} can make out a blue-jacketed hobgoblin hunched over some machine."
      - The thing was large, and barely resembled an open-top carriage. Yet, it had
        no horses in front, was made entirely of metals, and had a strange jut out
        the front, where more scraps of metal lay in a hollow.
      - "\u201COh good! *Someone* came.\u201D He stood up straight from his tinkering,\
        \ up to his full height of six and a half feet."
      - "\u201CThanks for droppin\u2019 by! I needed a good tester\u2014someone that\
        \ actually fit in the darn thing. You look\u2026 good enough.\u201C He stepped\
        \ to the side, opening the half-size door on the misshapen carriage."
      - The moment she stepped in, he began running {name} through the half-dozen
        controls at a breakneck speed. You only understood about half of what he said,
        his speech sprinkled with every figure of speech and artificer-jargon she
        could imagine.
      - Once his spiel was done, he placed a small, jagged key into the slot, and
        gave it a twist.
      - As he did, the hunk of metal at the front sputtered to life, sending the whole
        carriage into an idle rumble.
      - '{name} asked the hobgoblin if this machine was safe.'
      - "\u201CSafe enough! I took a few drives in it. I didn\u2019t fit, but I still\
        \ made it out ok.\u201D"
      - "His words weren\u2019t aspiring much hope. {name} knew hobgoblins to be a\
        \ particularly tough-skinned species."
      - "\u201CThis street goes in a loop around the city walls.\u201D He pointed\
        \ off into the distant road that ever so slightly curved right. \u201CIt\u2019\
        s busy this time around, so try to be slow.\u201D He stepped away, fully expecting\
        \ her to take off."
      - '{name} tapped on the pedal. With a roar, the carriage surged forward ten
        feet, continuing to roll for longer. Remembering his lecture, she planted
        her foot on the left pedal, violently jerking her forward as the vehicle came
        to an immediate stop.'
