      As {name} pressed the pulp into thin sheets, [he|she] struck conversation with the worker across from [him|her].
      
      "How long have you worked here for?" [He|She] asked.
      
      "Not long," the Satyr responded, "Just a few months."
       
      {name} left it at that, and continued [his|her] work.
      
      Aside from small talk with [his|her] coworkers, there was nothing else of note for {name}'s workday.

      {name} found [himself|herself] working with the Satyr again.
  
      You're new right? You started here just a few days ago?"
      
      "That's right." {name} confirmed.
      
      "You don't look like you belong." After a confused look from {name}, he clarified. "You seem more the adventurer type. The kind to travel from town to town. Nomadic-like.
      
      "I am a traveller, actually. Just staying here for the time being though, while I get some things straightened out."
      
      He nodded quietly, and didn't say much more.

      As [he|she] entered, {name} noticed the pressroom was in a hurry, more than it has the past few days. [He|She] put [his|her] apron on with agency, and got into place.

      "Wednesday publishing," the Satyr explained without [him|her] asking, "every Wednesday, the market bridge on the east side restocks *everytihng*. We get a lot of sales from just selling newspapers at that market, apparently."

      He uses his whole strength to pull down the sheet press. As he lifts it up, the strength of the spring almost lifts him off his feet.

      "I heard we have some folks that buy up papers just to sell outside the city."

      With the help of some extra workers, [he|she] and the Satyr press nearly double the amount of papers in a single day.
