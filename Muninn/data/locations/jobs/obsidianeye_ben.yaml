      The office seemed to be entirely consisting of paper-pushing and letter-sending. The one who interviewed {name} gave you some scant introductions to the job, and promptly left. The whole day was spent summarizing letters from regions around Arinoden. The pay was quite meager for this kind of work. [He|She] debates even returning the next day.

      Today's work was more of the same. {name} spent the entirety of the workday compiling letters and constructing reports about the regions' overall health. Even worse, [his|her] coworkers offer little talk. Any attempts to engage were quickly quenched.

      This job would be dreadfully boring, were it not for the letters [he|she] was able to read. Noting the small differences between how diplomats composed letters was the only thing keeping you interested.

      Someone *finally* talked to [him|her].

      “Everything going well, {name}?” It was [his|her] employer, a lady who you recently discovered is named *Is’sthra*.

      “Yes, it is.” You resist complaining. This elf would probably not be so happy with murmuring on the job.

      “Good. Keep up your work; you’ve done an excellent job with your reports.” She curtly walked away, not expecting your response.

      [His|Her] boss’s encouragement was a small uplift, but it didn’t make the job any less boring.

      Nothing interesting happened.

      Nothing interesting happened.

      Within your pile of letters, one was written from the neighboring kingdom. You quickly placed it into the discard pile.
